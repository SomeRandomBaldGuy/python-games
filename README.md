# Games.py

This is small project I've been working on.

I'm well aware that I am most likely breaking some 'rules', as well as making my code less 'pythonic'. 

This program has lots of blank space and unnessecary 'fluff' because it helps me verify it's working properly.

I'm always open to suggestions and CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.
